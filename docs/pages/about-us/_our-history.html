      <h2>Our history</h2>
      <p>In the heart of Waterloo, a new dawn in packaging emerged three decades ago. Chris Bird, deeply rooted in a family lineage of packaging expertise, envisioned a different kind of venture with Packaging Too. While the legacy of his familyâ€™s passion in packaging set a sturdy foundation, Chris set out to fill a void no one else was addressing.</p>
      <p>Packaging Too was built on two groundbreaking pillars: unparalleled flexibility and a relentless focus on customer service. Understanding the evolving needs of businesses, Chris broke the norm and introduced something revolutionary: No Minimum Order Quantity. This decision wasn't just about business; it was about understanding and valuing every customer's unique requirements, whether they needed one box or a thousand.</p>
